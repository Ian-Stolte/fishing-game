  "Dialogue": {
    "0": "You and Rein spend a few hours hiking through the woods and exploring the rugged coastline to the north of the village.",
    "1": "It's cold out, but you both bundle up in thick fur jackets and press on through a drizzling rain to reach the top of a little rise.",
    "2": "As you stop to rest in the old wooden gazebo that sits atop the hill, Rein turns toward you with a question in her eyes.",
    "3": "\"Hey, {name}. I don't know if I mentioned this before, but... I've been getting pretty into my paintings recently. And I think I'm going to get a show soon!\"",
    "4": "\"I just--- ***there's just one problem;** I only have landscapes. ***I mean, there's nothing wrong with landscapes**--I love landscapes**--but** I figured maybe it'd be best to branch out?\"",
    "5": "\"**Aaaaand also my patron said I should or the show would be a failure so...\"",
    "6": "Is it just you or is she avoiding your eyes? **Either way, you should probably speak up before she psychs herself out of whatever she wants to ask.",
    "7": "\"Yes. I'll do it. Your show <i>will not</i> be a failure.\"",
    "8": "\"Your patron doesn't know what she's talking about! Your landscapes are beautiful.\"",
    "9": "\"Oh, you should do a portrait of Ol 'Enry! People would love that!\"",
    "10": "Painting-OfYou",
    "11": "\"Wait, but I didn't even ask you--\"",
    "12": "You tell her you're up for pretty much whatever, as long as it helps out her art show. Judging by the sudden relief on her face, you guess she must have been pretty stressed about this.",
    "13": "\"Alright, thank you so much! I'll just paint you doing whatever you want to represent you---fishing, exploring, haggling with shopkeepers...\"",
    "14": "\"Actually, do you have time {time+2}?\"",
    "15": "You tell her you that even if you don't, you'll make time. ***Although, what could you really have scheduled at this point... visiting the docks? Drinks at the bar?",
    "16": "Either way, Rein seems happy as you trek down to the village, and the miserable drizzle even lets up to mirror her mood.** Nice!",
    "17": "",
    "18": "\"Thanks, but I really don't want to argue with her... I mean, she <i>is</i> my patron. Which means, you know, she gives me money to do art.\"",
    "19": "\"If I anger her, she can just stop supporting me.*** I'd have to stop painting, get a day job... I---**uh, I'd rather just do a portrait\"",
    "20": "\"Ok, how about you do one of me?\"",
    "21": "\"Hmm... maybe 'Enry would be willing to let you paint him?\"",

    "24": "Painting-Of'Enry",
    "25": 27,
    "26": "Painting-Of'Enry",
    "27": "\"Oh, that is a good idea... people love him, don't they?\"",
    "28": "You're not sure how much she <i>believes</i> what she's saying, but she's not wrong. People do love 'Enry, and you know a portrait of him will be a hit.",
    "29": "So why can't you shake the feeling that you somehow missed something?",
    "30": "\"Alright, see you {name}! Thanks for exploring with me, even if the weather was determined to make us regret it.\""
