    "1": "You and Rein spend a few hours hiking through the woods and exploring the rugged coastline to the north of the village.",
    "2": "It's cold out, but you both bundle up in thick fur jackets and press on through a drizzling rain to reach the top of a little rise.",
    "3": "As you stop to rest in the old wooden gazebo that sits atop the hill, Rein turns toward you with a question in her eyes.",
    "4": "\"Hey, {name}. I don't know if I mentioned this before, but... I've been getting pretty into my paintings recently. And I think I'm going to get a show soon!\"",
    "5": "\"I just??? ***there's just one problem;** I only have landscapes.",
    "6": "I mean, there's nothing wrong with landscapes**???I love landscapes**???but I figured maybe it'd be best to branch out?\"",
    "7": "\"**Aaaaand also my patron said I should or the show would be a failure so...\"",
    "8": "Is it just you or is she avoiding your eyes? **Either way, you should probably speak up before she psychs herself out of whatever she wants to ask.",
    "9": "\"Yes. I'll do it. Your show <i>will not</i> be a failure.\"",
    "10": "\"Your patron doesn't know what she's talking about! Your landscapes are beautiful.\"",
    "11": "\"Oh, you should do a portrait of Ol 'Enry! People would love that!\"",
    "12": "",
    "13": "\"Wait, but I didn't even ask you???\"",
    "14": "You tell her you're up for pretty much whatever, as long as it helps out her art show.",
    "15": "Judging by the sudden relief on her face, you guess she must have been pretty stressed about this.",
    "16": "\"Alright, thank you so much! I'll just paint you doing whatever you want to represent you???fishing, exploring, haggling with shopkeepers...\"",
    "17": "\"Actually, do you have time {time+2}?\"",
    "18": "Painting-OfYou [Rein paints my portrait, 2]",
    "19": "You tell her you that even if you don't, you'll make time. ***Although, what could you really have scheduled at this point... visiting the docks? Drinks at the bar?",
    "20": "Either way, Rein seems happy as you trek down to the village, and the miserable drizzle even lets up to mirror her mood.** Nice!",
    "21": "",
    "22": "\"Thanks, but I really don't want to argue with her... I mean, she <i>is</i> my patron. Which means, you know, she gives me money to do art.\"",
    "23": "\"If I anger her, she can just stop supporting me.*** I'd have to stop painting, get a day job... I???**uh, I'd rather just do a portrait\"",
    "24": "\"Ok, how about you do one of me?\"",
    "25": "\"Hmm... maybe 'Enry would be willing to let you paint him?\"",

    "29": 31,
    "30": "",
    "31": "Painting-Of'Enry [3]",
    "32": "\"Oh, that is a good idea... people love him, don't they?\"",
    "33": "You're not sure how much she <i>believes</i> what she's saying, but she's not wrong. People do love 'Enry, and you know a portrait of him will be a hit.",
    "34": "So why can't you shake the feeling that things didn't go the way they were supposed to?",
    "35": "\"Alright, see you {name}! Thanks for exploring with me, even if the weather was determined to make us regret it.\""
