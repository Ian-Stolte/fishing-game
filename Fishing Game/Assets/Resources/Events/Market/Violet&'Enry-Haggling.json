    "1": "As you approach, you overhear 'Enry and Violet in the midst of a heated negotiation.",
    "2": "\"10 serpents was the price yesterday, and it's the price today! You gone hard of hearing in your old age, 'Enry?\"",
    "3": "\"Ah, but that's the price for a real bottom-feeder! This here's a genuine specimen.\"",
    "4": "\"Bastard fought me for five whole minutes 'fore I could get him right an' proper off the hook!\"",
    "5": "\"You know, I bet I could take 'im to the honest 'mongers down the road and get 20???no, 30 serpents, easy!\"",
    "6": "\"Can't fool me that easy, friend; I can smell the rot from here! Bet that fish is so old you'd have to pay me to take it off your hands.\"",
    "7": "The two of them don't even notice you approach???you bet they'd be up to this all day if you don't intervene...",
    "8": "\"It's true! I watched him haul in the fish this morning. Fresh as can be, and strong too!\"",
    "9": "Cover your nose and pretend to gag: \"Ahhckhh, the smell! I can't breathe!\"",
    "10": "",
    "11": "Relationship-'Enry [+1]",
    "12": "\"Aye, at least a 30-serpent fish, clearly!\"",
    "13": "You suggest that it might even be worth 40, and Violet scowls at both of you.",
    "14": "\"Fine, fine???take your pay, 'Enry. And I suppose you've got 'rare specimens' for me, too, {name}?\"",
    "15": "",
    "16": "'Enry winks at you as you step forward to the stall and gives you a hearty pat on the back.",
    "17": "\"You know, I was right there when {they} caught this latest one... rare doesn't even begin to describe it!\"",
    "18": "You may have irritated Violet, but you decide the delight on 'Enry's face is well worth it.",
    "19": "In fact, you spend the rest of the {time} coming up with progressively more elaborate ways to mess with Violet, including the ultra-rare Striped Bass!",
    "20": "'Legend says there's only one of them in the world,' you tell her (although you conveniently leave out the empty paint bucket behind you...)",
    "21": "",
    "22": "Relationship-Violet [+1]",
    "23": "\"Hah, I knew it! Good luck taking that rotting lump to another fishmonger; bet they'd throw you out of the market for the smell alone!\"",
    "24": "\"Betrayed by a fellow sailor???oh, it stings just like old times!\"",
    "25": "He dramatically walks off, monologuing about the pain of betrayal, which leaves you alone with Violet for the moment!",
    "26": "",
    "27": "\"Thanks, {name}. Can't resist a bit of haggling with 'Enry???else he'd single-handedly run me out of business with all the rare fish he finds!\"",
    "28": "Charm > 4",
    "29": "\"That was incredible acting, though; it's almost like you've been practicing for this or something!",
    "30": "...that was acting, right?",
    "31": "Charm < 5",
    "32": "\"If I could make one comment, though... you might want to go a <i>bit</i> more subtle next time.\"",
    "33": "\"Maybe skip the whole 'arm-flailing and screaming about your nose falling off' part?\""
