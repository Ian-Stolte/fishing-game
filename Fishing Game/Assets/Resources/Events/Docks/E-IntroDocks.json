    "0": "",
    "1": "You make your way down the familiar wooden pier to the edge of the water, crouching to dip a hand into the lapping waves.",
    "2": "It's cold, of course, sending a shock through your arm and threatening to turn your hand numb if you leave it in much longer.",
    "3": "But you live for that feeling: the quiet electricity of the sea.",
    "4": "",
    "5": "As you push off from the dock and cast your line into the water you notice another sailor already in the midst of the day's fishing.",
    "6": "He looks up as you row out toward him, and you instantly recognize the fisherman of local legend: Ol 'Enry himself.",
    "7": "'Enry-Intro",
    "8": "\"Ahoy there! Careful with ya oars; the bass be on high alert today!\"",
    "9": "Strangely enough you've never spoken to the man yourself, though you've heard bits of his stories many a time walking into the Mermaid's Tale.",
    "10": "Guess this is your one chance to make a first impressionâ€”but what approach to take?",
    "11": "\"Aye! Shiver me timbers if it ain't a fellow cap'n of the high seas! Ahoy and avast!\"",
    "12": "Give a friendly nod and pull in your oars.",
    "13": "",
    "14": "You draw on your years of practice and deliver the best pirate voice you've got****; and somehow, it seems to work!",
    "15": "\"Blimey! Didn't wager I'd happen upon another voyager of the high seas today!\"",
    "16": "\"Where might your travails take ya on this bloody {time}?\"",
    "17": "You tell him you were just moving the boat out to fish the dock (in your pirate voice of course), and he gives you a grizzled smile.",
    "18": "\"Is that so! Might as well weigh anchor here, then, and keep an old fisherman company. I await tales of pillage and plunder!\"",
    "19": "Charm [1]",
    "20": "Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! This new you is feeling more charismatic by the second. Maybe you should just speak like this all the time!",
    "21": "",
    "22": "\"Appreciate it.**** You know, the fish know far more than we give them credit for.\"",
    "23": "\"They can feel when you come up on 'em with ill intent! Best to let ya ship drift in like yer just floating there.\"",
    "24": "\"'Be one with the ocean and it be one with you' I always say!\"",
    "25": "You can't tell if 'Enry expects a response, but by the time you've come up with something his gaze has already drifted back to his line.",
    "26": "Still, it's nice to have company as you while away a few hours, fishing side by side."
